    <h1>My first project uploadation on git hub </h1>
    <p> Today I am going to upload my first project on github</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Here,Firstly 
            I'm going to learn about how to to make an Github reposistory  </li>
        <li>Nextly, we are going to add our project on that resposistory</li>
        <li> After that we are going to make an project and update it on our reposistory on Github </li>

 <h2> Uses of Git </h2> 
 <ol>
    <li>Git is a version control system that helps developers track changes to their code over time.</li>
    <li>It allows multiple developers to collaborate on the same project without overwriting each other's changes.</li>
    <li>Git provides a history of changes, making it easy to revert to previous versions if needed.</li>
    <li>It supports branching and merging, enabling developers to work on new features or bug fixes in isolation before integrating them into the main codebase.</li>
    <li>Git is widely used in the software development industry and is an essential tool for modern development workflows.</li>
 </ol>  
 <p>Uses of GitHub</p>
 <ol>
    <li>GitHub is a web-based platform that hosts Git repositories and provides a collaborative environment for developers.</li>
    <li>It allows developers to share their code with others, making it easy to collaborate on open-source projects or team projects.</li>
    <li>GitHub provides features such as pull requests, code reviews, and issue tracking, which facilitate collaboration and improve code quality.</li>
    <li>It offers integration with various development tools and services, enhancing the overall development workflow.</li>
    <li>GitHub also serves as a portfolio for developers, showcasing their projects and contributions to the community.</li>
    <li> It also helps up to join our codes with our friends and colleagues </li>
 </ol>
